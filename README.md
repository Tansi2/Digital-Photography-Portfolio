## Welcome to Tansi's Digital Portfolio 

![flower](Bright%20Pink%20Flower.jpg)

This picture was taken at Whintey High School. Nature is a beautiful thing to capture with the power of a camera and flowers, in particular, are my favorite things to take pictures of. The vibrancy of colors and the blur of the background can be done using photo editing softwares and can really enhance the image. Furthermore, the contrast in this image of the pink and green adds to overall picture and makes it more appealing to the eye.
